Testing REST API layers ie. routes, validation, controller, repositories, etc separately are tedious and repetitive. Iâ€™d argue in most cases are unnecessary as most of REST API are simply to designed perform repetitive CRUD operations. 

This repository is to show the architecture I've done in the past to perform end to end test of those layers, thus reducing the need of more granular testing strategies using Symfony 4, Doctrine, and Sqlite.
